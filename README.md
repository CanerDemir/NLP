#### Detection Author of a Text in Turkish
The aim of the project is determining the author of a given text. I try to define  an appropriate characterization of documents that captures the writing style of the authors.

The most important approaches to computer based author identification are exclusively based on lexical measures.
There is an article about author detection [here](http://www.google.com.tr/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCAQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.yildiz.edu.tr%2F~diri%2FICANN.pdf&ei=wRb-VLD7EYKtUbyjgfgC&usg=AFQjCNGeVVAacCuWL2ibkj-QM9j8QNfejQ&bvm=bv.87611401,d.d24).
