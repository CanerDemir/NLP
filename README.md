#### Author Detection of a Text Written in Turkish
#####Descripton:
The aim of the project is determining the author of a given text. I try to define  an appropriate characterization of documents that captures the writing style of the authors. Let me explain what I mean by style of the authors; the authors use different words to write something about the same subject or some authors use special sentences many times in their  article, etc. My job is found that words, special sentences of the authors to create their style. When we know the style of an author, we can detect his/her text which unknown author. 

The most important approaches to computer based author identification are exclusively based on lexical measures.

#####A way to do:
May be I try to write some train models for styling the authors with words or sentences. And then using these models to create some clusters about authors. Actually using K-Means to find authors. 
#####Project Requirements:
  Java, The OpenNLP

#####Steps for Done
1. All training set contains 10 different texts for each of some authors.(+)
2. Counting words in given texts about authors.(+)
3. Using number of words to create clusters.(-)
4. Pointing the centroid of each clusters.(-)
5. Test some given texts.(-)  
   *(+) means the work is done.*  
   *(-) means the work not is done yet.*
